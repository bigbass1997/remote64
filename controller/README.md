### Description
This is the hardware side of the remote64 project, to enable remote control of a Nintendo 64 console.

The board uses a PIC18F47K42 microcontroller to handle controller input passthrough, via a USB/UART bridge. It also controls two relays which can be hooked up to the power switch of the N64, to remotely power the console on/off as needed.
